# deep3dmap
This an 3d reconstruction pipeline in deep learning.

# Introduction

<details open>
<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the reconstruction framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized reconstruction framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks of 3d reconstruction from image or images**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary reconstruction frameworks, *e.g.* , etc.

- **differential renderers**

  The toolbox support different differential renderers include neural rerender, 

- **support varigrained reconstructon**
  We suppert face, body, indoor, outdoor and so on
